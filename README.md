# Introduction

I present to you a backend project developed with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript!

This project transforms into a RESTful API designed to feed any frontend, following the standards of a RESTful API. 

## What is its main purpose? 

To facilitate the control of the well-being of our beloved pets.

With this web application, you can efficiently manage the vaccination calendar of your furry patients, keep a detailed record of the use of external and internal antiparasitic supplies, and control the consumption of balanced food.

## The objective? 

To maintain an accurate tracking of the needs of each pet, from when they need more food to when it's time for a new visit to the veterinarian.

Moreover, you will be able to generate, track, and control the complete clinical history of each pet, allowing personalized and effective care.

Don't miss the opportunity to improve the attention and tracking of your furry friends with this project.
